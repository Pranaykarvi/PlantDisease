# PlantDisease
Overview
This project is a machine learning web application utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to make predictions based on user input data. The project includes a Jupyter notebook for training and evaluating the CNN model and a Streamlit-based web application (App.py) for interaction with the model.

# Project Structure
1.Train_Dataset.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook focused on:
    Data preprocessing and exploration
    
    Model training using a CNN for effective feature extraction and classification
    
    Evaluation of the model's performance
    
    Saving the trained CNN model for use in the web app
    
2.App.py: A Streamlit web application that enables:
    
    User input of data for predictions
    
    Integration with the CNN model for generating and displaying results



# Model Training
The CNN model is trained on a prepared dataset in Train_Dataset.ipynb, which includes:
Training and validation phases to assess accuracy and loss
Saving the trained CNN model for predictions in the web application
